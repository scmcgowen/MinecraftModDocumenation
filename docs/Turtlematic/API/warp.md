# Warp API

Warp API essentially comes from harvesting power of The End itself. It allows you to jump to previously stored points instantly and with reduced cost.

> [!danger]
> Due to ComputerCraft limitations all stored points data will be lost if you unequip turtle upgrade.

> [!danger]
> This API is dimension-bound. If you somehow change turtle dimension this will require full reset

> [!warning]
> Points are limited per upgrade. It controlled by `endAutomataCoreWarpPointLimit` Minecraft settings and by default it is 64
