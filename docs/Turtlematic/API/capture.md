# Capture API

Capture API allows moving block or entities with storing it internal data! So finally, you can move specific spawners and chests!

Take a note, that released entity or block will be placed at front of turtle. Also, block can be placed only on empty space

> [!danger]
> Due to ComputerCraft limitations stored entity will be lost if you unequip turtle upgrade.
