# Beacon
<span class="describeimg">![[beacon.png]]</span>
If you ever wants to control beacon automatically and change it powers, now you can!

## Beacon configuration

Beacon configuration can be complicated at first, but you need to think about it like regular beacon configuration:

- You select one of primary powers with `power` argument (should be effect id, like `effect.minecraft.haste`, full list you can get via `getPossiblePowers()`)
- Than you need to selected inventory with payment for beacon reconfiguration. By default, this method will take first item in this inventory with `minecraft:beacon_payment_items` tag, but you can specify exact item ID (like `minecraft:iron_ingot`) via optional `item` parameter.
- If your beacon has 4 level, by default selected effect will get second level. If you want to select regeneration instead, pass `regeneration` as true.
