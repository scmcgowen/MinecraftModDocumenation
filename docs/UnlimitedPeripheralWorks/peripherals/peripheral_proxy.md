Cables seem a little obsolete now, in the real world you can freely use wireless transfer (even for energy and items), why shouldn't this work in Minecraft? So, here is the peripheral proxy, a nice tool to connect remote peripherals to the computer without actual wires. Sadly it has limited range, but you can't have everything, can you?

## How to configure

To configure the peripheral proxy, you can use the [ultimate configurator](ultimate_configurator.md). 

## Supported APIs

- `peripheral_hub` api for CC:T, so this upgrade actually work as modem and provide access to peripherals inside it.
