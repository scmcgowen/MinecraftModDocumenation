There is no significat diferrences from Digital Items 2 , but all things related to energy consumption are not implemented yet. This mod allows you to turn your items into numbers (called IDs), which you can store or send to your friends and then turn them back into their item form. Every ID is unique, can't be guessed, and can only be used once. No duplication or cloning of items is possible. The process of turning an item into an ID is called 'digitization' and turning it back is called 'rematerialization'. Items that are digitized begin to 'decay'. If they are left digitized for too long, they are gone. You can reset their 'decay countdown' by 'refreshing' an item ID or partially rematerializing it. You can retrieve information about digitized items via their ID and items inside the digitizer itself. All of these operations are performed inside the 'digitizer', and require a configurable amount of energy. These operations are exposed in the form of a peripheral for the CC: Tweaked mod. Supported versions \u00b6 Forge : 1.20.x (features) Fabric : 1.20.x (features) Q. & A. \u00b6 How do I use this mod? \u00b6 Place a digitizer and computer (either directly next to one another or connected with network cables and modems). Place the item you want to digitize inside the digitizer. Now you can interact with the digitizer with lua. Use digitizer = peripheral.find(\"digitizer\") to find the peripheral and bind it to the digitizer variable. The following methods are available to call on the digitizer peripheral: inventory methods from CC:T to make it will like actual inventory peripheral getDecayEnabled() Returns whether the digital items decay. getDecayTicks() Returns the duration in ticks after which digital items decay. digitize() Digitizes the item stack and returns the ID. digitizeAmount(amount) Like digitize() but only digitizes amount items leaving the rest in the digitizer. rematerialize(id) Rematerializes the item stack associated with the provided ID and places it inside the digitizer. rematerializeAmount(id, amount) Like rematerialize(id) but only rematerializes amount items. Resets the decay countdown for the remaining stack. refresh(id) Refreshes the item stack associated with that ID. getIDInfo(id) Returns a table containing currentTime (current world age in ticks), digitizedAt (time when the item stack got digitized), decaysAt (time when the item stack will decay), lastRefresh (time when the item stack got last refreshed) and item containing information about the actual item stack.

Take a note, that some peripherals (actually, a lot of them) will have extra functions besides supported APIs. Parameters description \u00b6 Functions defined like call_name(required_arg_1: arg_type_1, required_arg_2: arg_type_2, optional_arg: arg_type_3) . Some types will have additional limitations, like \"only positive numbers\", or \"only numbers in specific range\". In case when limitations are not met, function will throw exception. New data types \u00b6 Mostly this sections contains enums, that are need to be passed as strings. Enums are case-insensetive, so you can pass them as you want. Name Lua type Limitations interactionMode string Enum with values: any, block, entity areaInteractionMode string Enum with values: item, block, entity direction string Enum with values: up, down Result boolean, string? - Result[T] T?, string? - Interaction mode \u00b6 All functions, that accept interactionMode as arguments, work with objects in line of sight. They will take as target the first object, that they found. You can force this functions to work only with blocks, or only with entities. Info You can get available interactionMode for specific APIs on peripheral documentation page. All available values is both , entity and block Warning Pretty important to note that a lot of entity interaction will be limited to specific entities. For example, Husbandry Automata Core allows to works only with animals. Always checks peripheral documentation page to understand its limitation with entities. Area interaction mode \u00b6 All functions, that accept areaInteractionMode as arguments, work with objects in specific radius around it. You can get this radius via getConfiguration() method. Use this parameter to select what objects should to used for operation. Info You can get available areaInteractionMode for specific APIs on peripheral documentation page. All available values is item , entity and block Warning Pretty important to note that a lot of entity interaction will be limited to specific entities. For example, Husbandry Automata Core allows to works only with animals. Always checks peripheral documentation page to understand its limitation with entities. Direction \u00b6 All functions, that accept direction as arguments, work with objects in line of sight. You can use this argument to change line of sight and fake peripheral player will begin to start to look down (or up). Result \u00b6 Result are always representing result of called operation. First argument will tell you is operation was successful and second one will tell you reason why operation is failed. Result can also be parametrized, for example as Result[number] , which means it will return operation result as first argument (or nil) and as second argument it will tell you reason why operation is failed. ItemQuery \u00b6 Warning Before 1.19.4, ItemQuery type did not exist, so instead of it you can use only the string version of this argument ItemQuery is a powerful argument, that is supposed to help you build filters for items, extracting them in a more precise way, than just item ID. You can pass to an argument, that has type ItemQuery a string, and it will become just a regular item ID filter. But you can also pass a table { nbt = \"<item nbt hash>\" , tag = \"minecraft:lapis_ores\" , displayName = \"Deepslate Lapis Lazuli Ore\" , name = \"minecraft:deepslate_lapis_ore\" } A table can have zero or more keys and all of them will be required from the item at once.
